# MUSC 255 Sound Installation
Welcome to my sound installation for MUSC 255 - Electroacoustic Music Composition  

## Abstract
The goal of this installation is to explore the realm of live generative music based on video streams. Using a live webcam, the program tracks the movement across frames and measures the change in color. Based on the intensity of the color change, notes are generated to simulate the movement observered.  

## Applications
The intended application for this project is to create ambient sounds that reflect the observed video stream and provide stimulating responses. For example, if recording a video of a bright, tropical rainforest, the hope is that the program will generate vibrant and complex sounds to accompany the video. For a video of trees blowing in the wind, the program might generate a soothing and soft composition. 

## Expanding
Currently, this project uses raw color pixels, generalizations of color intensity, and partialy random note choice. The hope is that this project can turn into something bigger that can abstract better information from the video and improve the songwriting ability.
